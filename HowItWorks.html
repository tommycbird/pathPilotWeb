            <h1>How it Works</h1>
            <p>Our application, Path Pilot, utilizes a sophisticated blend of technology and user-centric design, a cornerstone of our innovative vision. At its core, Path Pilot ingeniously streamlines the process of mapping unique running routes, transforming a mundane task into an exciting exploration opportunity.</p>
            <p>Upon activation, the application discerns the user's current location, providing the base from which the route begins. Leveraging a proprietary algorithm, the system then disperses a defined set of points randomly within the vicinity of the user's location. These seemingly arbitrary points are 'snapped' onto the nearest roads, walkways, or trails, using advanced geospatial techniques, ensuring that every path generated is not only safe but also practical.</p>
            <p>Next, these 'snapped' points serve as nodes in a complex web of potential paths. We construct a comprehensive matrix that represents the users starting location in addition to all of the randomy created points. This intricate matrix then forms the substrate for our sophisticated path-finding algorithm, which draws parallels to the renowned 'Travelling Salesman Problem'. This algorithm meticulously weaves a route through these nodes, the culmination of which is a unique path that is within a close range of the user's desired running distance.</p>
            <p>This inovative process, from point generation to path craetion, unfolds seamlessly behind the scenes, ensuring our users enjoy a hassle-free experience while receiving routes tailored to their requirements. With Path Pilot, we invite you on a journey where each run is a new adventure, a unique discovery.</p>
