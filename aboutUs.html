            <h1>Our Background</h1>
            <p>As Computer Science students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), we recognized a unique opportunity to combine our academic studies with a real-world application. This inspired us to create Path Pilot, an innovative platform designed to transform the running experience.  We remain deeply committed to delivering a quality application that meets the needs of runners seeking a fresh perspective on their routes. With Path Pilot, we are proud to share our journey of self-taught Swift programming and application development with you, and we hope it enhances your running adventures.</p>
